## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** on the **MNIST dataset**. A CVAE is a probabilistic generative model that learns to reconstruct and generate images given a condition, in this case, the digit label.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of **variational inference** in deep learning and how CVAEs can be used for **image generation and representation learning**.


## ðŸŽ¯ Results

After training, the model should be able to generate new MNIST digits conditioned on the class label. Example of generated images:

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements

Improve latent space representation.
Tune hyperparameters for better image quality.
Experiment with different architectures (e.g., deeper CNN layers).
